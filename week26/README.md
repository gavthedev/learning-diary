- Bootcamp day 41 - AI Theory & ML Fundamentals 
- Studied AI types: Narrow vs General, Rule-based vs Learning-based, Reactive vs Memory-based
- Learned ML data requirements: quality, balance, labels, generalization issues
- Reviewed core ML algorithms: Linear Regression, SVM, k-NN, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naive Bayes
- Explored Deep Learning with neural nets: ANN, CNN, RNN, Transformers
- Studied generative models (GANs, VAEs, Diffusion) and use cases 
- Understood LLMs: pretraining, fine-tuning, tokenization strategies 
- Examined model limits: token context, pricing, real-world examples
  
- Bootcamp day 42 - OpenAI API & AI model ecosystem 
- Studied commercial vs self-hosted AI models: trade-offs, cost, performance, privacy
- Explored OpenAI API roles, message formatting 
- Loaded OpenAI keys securely via .env and used them in Python with 
- Created basic OpenAI chat client and image generator using DALL·E 2
- Learned structured response output with JSON schema, used  param
- Practiced downloading and saving generated image from API URL

Bootcamp day43
- Worked on domain modeling for a real-estate style platform 
- Clarified separation between what exists and what user wants
- Designed models with Swiss-market constraints
- Started DRF serializers and reviewed read vs write concerns
- Focused on clean architecture decisions before implementation
Bootcamp day44 - Relational database modeling & domain exploration 

- Practiced relational database design for a real-estate 
- Modeled core entities (locations, properties, renters, search criteria) 
- Focused on translating domain concepts into relational schemas

Next: align database concepts with Django models & API layer

Bootcamp day 45 - 
- Practiced nested JSON response structure and clarified all ID references for frontend use.
- Did deep research on backend image handling methods.
- Wrote full API route/methods doc.
- Clarified JWT /tokens/ behavior.
- Synced with frontend team: defined required endpoints and serializers needed per feature.

 Workday, no coding today
No coding today also, workday and rest for next week. Big project coming
