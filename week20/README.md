\nBootcamp day 21 Python Exercises, fundamentals & logic 
- Solved intro Python exercises: types, strings, lists, logic 
- Functions: is_string, is_only_string, is_alphanumeric
- Type validation: is_list_or_tuple, are_same_type
- Logic problems: intersection, convert (digits), count_repetition
- Range check with indexes 
- Split_the_bill logic 
- Recursions 
- Starting off strong into Python with real practice and theory
- Bootcamp day 21 , Python Advanced + OOP Exercises 
Solved 6 Python challenges using map/filter/functions
Exercises: Even Numbers, Square Elements, Squared Evens, Find Certain Numbers, compute_totals, Restaurant classes
Wrote versions with explicit for-loops + functional style (lambda/map/filter)
Practiced Class/Instance structure with Dish/Restaurant/Ingredients
Bootcamp day 23 Interview Prep: Algorithms
- Studied theory: What is an algorithm, space-time complexity, sorting vs searching
- Big O notation and runtime analysis: O(1), O(n), O(n^2), recursion
- Code runtime analysis: test, test2, test3, add_range (x3), factorial, mod
- Practiced algorithmic problems:
  • Duplicates in large list
  • Find missing number (sorted)
  • Reverse string without [::-1]
  • Longest word using reduce()
  • Merge two sorted lists
- Implemented classic algorithms in Python:
  • Binary search (iterative, no recursion)
  • Selection sort (in-place)
  • Merge sort (recursive with merge step)
- Optional reading: quicksort and binary search trees (insert, find, delete)
- Learned why these matter for interviews and not for daily dev work
