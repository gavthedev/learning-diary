Bootcamp day 21 – Python Exercises: Fundamentals & Logic  
- Solved intro Python exercises: types, strings, lists, logic  
- Functions: is_string, is_only_string, is_alphanumeric  
- Type validation: is_list_or_tuple, are_same_type  
- Logic problems: intersection, convert (digits), count_repetition  
- Range check with indexes  
- Split_the_bill logic  
- Recursions  
- Starting off strong into Python with real practice and theory  

Bootcamp day 22 – Python Advanced + OOP Exercises  
- Solved 6 Python challenges using map/filter/functions  
- Exercises: Even Numbers, Square Elements, Squared Evens, Find Certain Numbers, compute_totals, Restaurant classes  
- Wrote versions with explicit for-loops + functional style (lambda/map/filter)  
- Practiced Class/Instance structure with Dish/Restaurant/Ingredients  

Bootcamp day 23 – Interview Prep: Algorithms  
- Studied theory: What is an algorithm, space-time complexity, sorting vs searching  
- Big O notation and runtime analysis: O(1), O(n), O(n^2), recursion  
- Code runtime analysis: test, test2, test3, add_range (x3), factorial, mod  
- Practiced algorithmic problems:  
  • Duplicates in large list  
  • Find missing number (sorted)  
  • Reverse string without [::-1]  
  • Longest word using reduce()  
  • Merge two sorted lists  
- Implemented classic algorithms in Python:  
  • Binary search (iterative, no recursion)  
  • Selection sort (in-place)  
  • Merge sort (recursive with merge step)  
- Optional reading: quicksort and binary search trees (insert, find, delete)  
- Learned why these matter for interviews and not for daily dev work  
Bootcamp day 24 - Interview Prep: Data Structures 
- Reviewed closures, scoping rules and lexical environment
- Practiced *args, **kwargs and flexible function signatures
- Walrus operator := for inline assignments and clean logic
- Solved DS theory questions (lists, sets, stack vs queue, recursion, comparisons)
- Implemented closure factory function: create_base(x)
- Built custom Stack class with push/pop/top/is_empty/clear
- Built custom Queue class with enqueue/dequeue/first/is_empty/clear
- Built custom Set class with insert/remove/has/all/length
- Trained on interview patterns: deduplication, compression, missing chars
- Practiced runtime reasoning & debugging without execution

Bootcamp day 25 - Databases & SQL in Python 
- Studied theory on relational databases 
- Learned primary keys, foreign keys, relationships across tables
- Worked with SQLite & DB Browser
- Practiced SELECT with filtering, sorting, LIMIT/OFFSET, JOIN
- Used SQL in Python (sqlite3), created DB file + tables 
- Inserted dummy data and executed queries from Python scripts
- Learned parameterized queries for SQL injection protection
- Prepared structure for TODO CLI App (CRUD over SQLite)
  
 No coding today, rest day getting ready for an upcomming strong week!
 
  Sunday: did some warmup on next week's materials - Django
