Monday, workday. Studying over Christmas will start tomorrow
Bootcamp christmas break practice + workday. Started by practicing project creation from scratch and creation of models for different apps

Bootstrapped a Docker-only Django backend template (Postgres + DRF).
Added custom User model early (email login) and wired JWT auth endpoints.
Split settings into base/dev/prod and added Swagger docs (drf-yasg).
Set up docker-compose for dev/ci/deploy and ran initial migrations.
